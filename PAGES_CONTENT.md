<div class="about-page">
  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>Basenotes was born from a simple belief: everyone deserves access to the world's most extraordinary fragrances without the extraordinary price tag.</p>

  <p>Founded in 2024, we set out to democratize luxury perfumery. We noticed that the most captivating scents—the ones crafted by master perfumers using rare ingredients—were locked behind $300+ price tags. Most people would never experience them.</p>

  <p>We changed that.</p>

  <h2>The Basenotes Difference</h2>
  <p>Unlike other fragrance subscriptions that offer watered-down designer scents, we focus exclusively on <strong>10 meticulously curated fragrances</strong> from our in-house atelier. Each scent is:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Crafted with intention</strong> — No filler fragrances. Every scent in our collection earned its place.</li>
    <li><strong>Made with premium ingredients</strong> — Real oud, genuine rose absolute, high-quality musks.</li>
    <li><strong>Exclusive to Basenotes</strong> — You won't find these anywhere else.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why Only 10 Fragrances?</h2>
  <p>In a world of endless choices, we believe in the power of curation. Rather than overwhelming you with hundreds of mediocre options, we've perfected ten. Each fragrance represents a distinct olfactory journey—from bright citrus mornings to deep, smoky evenings.</p>

  <p>This focused approach means we can ensure every bottle meets our exacting standards. No compromises. No shortcuts.</p>

  <h2>Our Promise</h2>
  <p>When you subscribe to Basenotes, you're not just getting perfume. You're joining a community of fragrance enthusiasts who appreciate the art of scent. We promise:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Authentic, high-concentration fragrances (no diluted versions)</li>
    <li>Complete transparency about ingredients and sourcing</li>
    <li>A personalized experience tailored to your preferences</li>
    <li>The freedom to swap, skip, or cancel anytime</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Meet the Founder</h2>
  <p><strong>Wilson Wu</strong> — A lifelong fragrance enthusiast who spent years hunting down niche perfumes across three continents. After one too many disappointing subscription boxes filled with generic scents, Wilson decided to create the service he wished existed.</p>

  <p><em>"I wanted to build something for people like me—people who care deeply about what they put on their skin and how it makes them feel. Basenotes is that vision realized."</em></p>

## 2. FAQ PAGE

**Title:** Frequently Asked Questions
**URL Handle:** faq

### Content (copy below):

```html
<div class="faq-page">

  <h2>About the Subscription</h2>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>How does Basenotes work?</strong></summary>
    <p>It's simple: Choose your plan, take our scent quiz, and we'll send you an 8ml atomizer of premium fragrance each month. You can swap scents anytime, skip a month, or cancel whenever you want. No commitments, no hassle.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>What's included in my subscription?</strong></summary>
    <p>Every month you receive:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An 8ml atomizer (approximately 120 sprays — a full month's supply)</li>
      <li>Free shipping to your door</li>
      <li>Access to rate and review fragrances</li>
      <li>The ability to swap your upcoming scent anytime</li>
    </ul>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></summary>
    <p>We offer three plans:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Monthly:</strong> $20/month</li>
      <li><strong>Quarterly:</strong> $48 every 3 months ($16/month — save 20% + free travel case)</li>
      <li><strong>Annual:</strong> $168/year ($14/month — 2 months free + exclusive gifts)</li>
    </ul>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>Can I skip a month?</strong></summary>
    <p>Absolutely! Log into your account, go to your subscription settings, and click "Skip next month." You won't be charged, and your subscription will resume the following month.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>How do I cancel?</strong></summary>
    <p>We don't believe in trapping customers. Cancel anytime directly from your account dashboard—no phone calls, no guilt trips, no hoops to jump through.</p>
  </details>

  <h2>About the Fragrances</h2>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>What makes your fragrances different?</strong></summary>
    <p>Unlike mass-market subscription services, we don't offer hundreds of designer knock-offs. We've created 10 exclusive fragrances in our own atelier using premium ingredients—real Cambodian oud, Turkish rose absolute, and high-quality musks. These are scents you genuinely cannot find anywhere else.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>How do I choose which fragrance to receive?</strong></summary>
    <p>After subscribing, take our Scent Quiz to discover your fragrance profile. Based on your results, we'll recommend the perfect starting scent. You can also browse our full collection and manually select your next fragrance anytime.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>How long does 8ml last?</strong></summary>
    <p>Each 8ml atomizer contains approximately 120 sprays. If you use 3-4 sprays daily, one bottle lasts about a month. Our fragrances are highly concentrated, so a little goes a long way.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>Are your fragrances unisex?</strong></summary>
    <p>Most of our collection is designed to be worn by anyone. Fragrance has no gender! That said, some lean more traditionally masculine or feminine, and we note this in each product description.</p>
  </details>

  <h2>Shipping & Orders</h2>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>When will my order ship?</strong></summary>
    <p>New subscribers: Your first order ships within 1-2 business days. Recurring subscriptions ship on the 1st of each month. You'll receive tracking info via email.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>Do you ship internationally?</strong></summary>
    <p>Currently, we ship to the United States and Canada. We're working on expanding to more countries—join our newsletter to be notified when we launch in your region.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>Is shipping free?</strong></summary>
    <p>Yes! Free shipping on all subscription orders, always.</p>
  </details>
